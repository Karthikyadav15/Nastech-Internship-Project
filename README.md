Document Summarization The idea of document summarization is a bit different from keyphrase extraction or topic modeling. In this case, the end result is still in the form of some document, but with a few sentences based on the length we might want the summary to be. This is similar to an abstract or an executive summary in a research paper. The main objective of automated document summarization is to perform this summarization without involving human input, except for running computer programs. Mathematical and statistical models help in building and automating the task of summarizing documents by observing their content and context.
